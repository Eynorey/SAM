## 1\. Search available courses

### 1.1 Brief Description

The use case in question is supposed to create a tool for the user to find the courses he or she is interested in on the SAM Platform. Guests, as well as registered users, can search through courses available on the Website by clicking the "find a course" button. In the Search-View a number of search options should be presented to the user to make it easier to delimit the search to specific criteria like dates, duration, topic or teacher. After setting the desired parameters a key word can be entered into the search field. By pressing "Search"-button user confirms the search request and will be presented with the results in a list form.

### 2.2 Alternative Flows

## 3\. Special Requirements

### 3.1 Functionality

### 3.2 Usability

### 3.3 Reliability

### 3.4 Performance

Performance factor can be crucial to the usability of a search engine on the SAM platform. Therefore one of the most importance requirements in this use case is the minimization of search time. The user has to receive search results within the first 5 seconds after confirming his or her request.Â

### 3.10 Licensing Requirements

### 3.11 Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices

### 3.12 Applicable Standards

## 4\. Preconditions

There are no preconditions to this use case, as the user does not have to be registered on the platform in order to search through available courses.

## 5\. Postconditions

The following sections are listing possible states the system can be in immediately after a use case has finished.

### 5.1 Postcondition One

A number of courses found is 1 or larger. In this case a list of courses is presented under the search-field.

### 5.2 Postcondition Two

A number of courses found is 0\. In this case a notification is shown to the user, stating that the search had no success and key-words or parameters should be change in order to find needed course. A button "Create this course" should be shown below notifying the user that he can be the first one to offer a course with given parameters.

## 6\. Extension Points

The following sections represent a list of possible use case extensions.

### 6.1 Autofill

An autofill feature can be implemented to extend the use case. The search field would expand into a dynamic list of popular items searched before, starting with the same characters as the user's search-request.

### 6.2 Sort function

Along with the filters, user can be offered to filter the search results by date, rating or relevance.

## 7\. Function Points

### 7.1 External Inputs

The only user input, interacting with the internal logic files of the System, is taking place through creating a new user. This interacts with one file (file type reference, or FTR) - User Login-Data file and changes 8 data element types (DET's). Therefore the complexity for this row is low.

### 7.2 External Outputs

The output visible for the user is his registration information when account is created (e-mail). User Login-Data file is interacted with to show this information, but not all of the fields are accessed and displayed. Only user name and email will be shown to the user. Therefore the complexity can be estimated as low.

### 7.3 External Inquiries

There are 4 external inquiries in the use case.
* 3 are used to register with account data from other social media
* 1 is an interaction for picking the birth date from a pop-up calendar

Two files are being referenced in this case - a calendar and a User Login-Data table. Each only have a minor amount of data element types referenced. Therefore the complexity is low.

### 7.4 Internal Logical files
The User Login-Data table is the referenced ILF, which has one logical subgroup (RET) - User, and 8 different fields (DET). Complexity is therefore low. 

### 7.5 External Interface files
Only one file is used to interact with the external interfaces. It has a minor amount of referenced fields and therefore a low complexity. 

### 7.6 FP Estimation
As a result, the use case can be estimated with 15 Function Points.
