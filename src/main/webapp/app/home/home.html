            <h3> The Idea </h3>
            We provide a platform for people who want to teach and those who want to learn.
            <br>
            The more you teach, the more you can learn.
            <br>
            Help others so others can help you!
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3> How it works </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Share your knowledge</li>
                <li>Get reward points from the people you teach</li>
                <li>Use those points to give them to other people in exchange for their knowledge</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
